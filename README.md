# JavaScript Practice Repository

A collection of JavaScript exercises, algorithms, and mini-projects to improve my JavaScript skills.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository serves as my personal JavaScript playground for practicing concepts, solving algorithms, and building small applications to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## 📂 Contents

- **Algorithm Challenges**: Solutions to common coding problems like array manipulations
- **DOM Manipulation**: Simple web applications demonstrating JavaScript interaction with HTML
- **Mini Projects**: Small applications like the To-Do list app

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🧠 Learning Focus

- Array methods and manipulations
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Modern ES6+ features

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Code

Most examples can be run by:
1. Opening the HTML file in a browser
2. Using the browser console for algorithm challenges
3. Using Node.js for non-DOM examples: `node filename.js`

## 📝 Notes

This is a personal learning repository. Code may be refactored and improved as I learn new concepts and best practices.
